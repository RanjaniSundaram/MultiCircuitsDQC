the topology of a graph

## example: toy2-multichannel
 - before '-' are the nodes in **(node_id, memory, x, y)**. there are 7 nodes, where each node has a memory of 10 qubits. unit is in km, not m. because having too many zeros looks dizzy. the node id starts from 0 and increase by 1.
 - after the '-' are the edges in **(node_id, node_id, # of channels)**. there are 12 undiredect edges. # of channels varries from 1 to 4.
